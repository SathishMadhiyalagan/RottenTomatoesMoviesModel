# Rotten Tomatoes Movies Model

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a Machine Learning pipeline to predict **audience ratings** using a provided dataset. The code implements data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training with various regression techniques.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Outlier detection and removal
- Feature engineering (One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding)
- Regression models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Voting Regressor)
- Model evaluation (R², MAE, RMSE)

## Setup Instructions
This project is developed using **Python 3.11.0**. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SathishMadhiyalagan/RottenTomatoesMoviesModel
   cd RottenTomatoesMoviesModel
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv rotten_tomatoes_env
   source rotten_tomatoes_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: rotten_tomatoes_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**
   Install all the dependencies using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**
   Open and execute the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
